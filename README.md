here are instructions on how to make Rumi's sword "from scratch".  Good prop that is small / light enough to be held by 5-6 year old but will light up at night.

## Bill of Materials
Assuming you want the same structure and column titles as your previous request ("Item Name" and "Purchase Link"), here is the data converted into a markdown table:

| Item Name | Purpose | Purchase Link |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 3d print filament translucent blue/purple | 3-d print material for blade | [https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BHYRYHDY](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0BHYRYHDY) |
| 3d print filament gold metal | 3d print material for handle | [https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07RBSGZBM](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07RBSGZBM) |
| super glue | bond handles, blades, led strip and rod supports | [https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B1H2XD5S](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0B1H2XD5S) |
| battery-powered thin LED light strip | glow | [https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C4P9F9Y1](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C4P9F9Y1) |
| steel support rods | critical supports the handle pieces and blade.  the blade is hollow and quite fragile w/o these supports | https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CN79NZ7Y |

Also assumes you have a 3d printer (like a Bambu P1S) and standard accessoresies (a good pair of needle nose pliers to remove filament) and tape.

## 3d files

The 3d print files are versions of [Rumi Sword files from RavenCosplay](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:7094317) edited to be:
1. small enough to be held by 5-6 year old comfortably
2. hollow to holding led lights, wires and supports internally

## Instructions

1. 3d print all the sword pieces.  Those labeled "blue" should be printed in translucent blue/purple, and "gold" in the gold filament.  be very careful with removing the supports on the blade halves.

2. stack the handle pieces together and super glue.  In the middle hole, place 3 steel support rods and super glue as well.
