# üó°Ô∏è Making Rumi's Sword from KPop Demon Hunters

This guide provides instructions for creating a lightweight, glowing battery-powered replica of Rumi's sword, scaled for a 5-6 year old. The sword is designed with a hollow interior to house the LED lighting and internal steel supports.

# üõ†Ô∏è Assembly Instructions

1.  **Print Components:** 3D print all files. Use **translucent blue/purple** for blade parts and **gold metal** for handle parts. Carefully remove all printing supports, especially from the thin blade halves.

2.  **Reinforce Handle:** **Stack and super glue** the gold handle pieces. Insert and glue **three steel support rods** into the central core for structural integrity.

3.  **Prepare Blade Supports:** **Glue** the two blade halves together along *one* edge. Insert **two steel support rods** into the hollow interior (one on each side of the center channel) and glue them securely to the plastic walls.

4.  **Attach Handle to Blade:** **Super glue** the reinforced handle assembly, including its steel rods, to the base of the open blade assembly.

5.  **Route LED Wire:** Pass the **LED strip's power cable** (the end nearest the battery pack/switch) through the dedicated small hole near the blade's base.

6.  **Install Lighting:** Place the **LED strip** along the internal channel of the blade. Secure the strip with **tape and super glue** to prevent shifting and ensure light distribution.

7.  **Final Closure:** Apply **super glue** to the remaining open edges and secure the **remaining blade half**, fully sealing the sword around the lights and supports. Hold firmly until the glue is set.
